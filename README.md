# Algorithms in C#
A collection of algorithms written in C#

## General

### Manacher's Algorithm
Search for longest Palindrome substring and can also find all palindromic substring in O(n) time complexity.

|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
|O(n)|O(n)|O(n)|

## Graphs

### Ajacency List
Adjacency list representation of graph and iterative depth first and breadth first traversals


|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
||**BFS**||
|O(e)|O(e)|O(e)|
||**DFS**||
|O(e)|O(e)|O(e)|

## Sorts

### Heap Sort (Non-recursive)

|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
|O(n log n)|O(n log n)|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|

### Counting Sort
Counting sort is a fast sorting algorithm but is useful only in situations where number of distinct values are much smaller than total size.

|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
|O(n)|O(n)|O(n)|
