# Algorithms in C#
A collection of algorithms written in C#

### Heap Sort (Non-recursive)

|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
|O(n log n)|O(n log n)|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|

### Counting Sort
Counting sort is a fast sorting algorithm but is useful only in situations where number of distinct values are much smaller than total size.

|Best|Average|Worst|
|---|---|---|
|O(n)|O(n)|O(n)|
